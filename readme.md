#Frontend Mentor - Art gallery website

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this art gallery website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- **Bonus**: Use [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) to create an interactive location map with custom location pin

## My personal goals

This challenge had to be my personal exam before starting JavaScript learning. I felt quite confident with making it, hope I passed. ;)

## Tools I used

I used Flexbox with Grid section on main page. Except of that, I used Leaflet JS to make a map on location page.
